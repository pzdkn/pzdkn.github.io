    <summary>Who I am</summary>
    <p>
        I am Machine Learning Engineer @ Merantix Momentum working on NLP Solutions
        such as RAG and Chatbots. I previously finished my Master's in Robotics at TU Darmstadt.
        I am passionate about the intersection of NLP and Robotics. In particular, how LLM can be leveraged
        for planning, navigation and manipulation tasks. Hit me up if you want to chat about this or anything else.<br><br>
